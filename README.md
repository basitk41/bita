## Introduction

This application is a lightweight, user-friendly platform built using the latest web technologies to deliver a seamless and engaging user experience. Developed with **React 18.3** and **TypeScript**, it leverages the high-performance capabilities of **Vite** for bundling and modern development workflows. The app employs **Styled Components** for modular and maintainable UI design, ensuring a visually appealing interface. With robust **unit testing** powered by **Jest** and **React Testing Library**, the application is built for reliability.

The application uses **Context API** for efficient state management tailored to its small size, avoiding unnecessary complexity. **React Query** optimizes data fetching and synchronization, while **Axios** handles API calls with ease. **React Router DOM** provides intuitive navigation across the application, and **ESLint** ensures clean and consistent code.
